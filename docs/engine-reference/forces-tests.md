A physics engine is only as trustworthy as its proof that each force behaves. This
document is that proof, in two registers: the **unit math** (each force's exact
per-frame Δv) and the **behavior** (the invariants that define "reacts appropriately").
The behavioral layer is a single declarative catalog that drives both the test suite
and the **Lab detector** ([`/lab`](https://field-ui.com/lab)) — so "did the expected
thing happen?" is answered identically in code and on screen.

The Lab is the human face of it: think of it like a particle collider. A known particle
goes into a known force; you watch its track, the surrounding field, and any related
particles; the measured behavior is checked against the prediction. If it matches, good.
If not, tune the attributes and fire again.

Scope: this document covers the **force engine** inside `@field-ui/core` — the
renderer-agnostic field computation, where particles are one agent type in the shared
field context. The conformance that binds the field runtime to the DOM (the platform
scheduler's phases, the six registries, `lintPlatform()`, and site-level conformance)
lives in [`../canonical/field-ui-testing-and-conformance.md`](../canonical/field-ui-testing-and-conformance.md).

## The five layers

| Layer | File(s) | Asks | Style |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Golden unit tests** | `forces/forces.test.ts`, `forces/natural.test.ts`, `forces/extended.test.ts` | Is each force's per-frame math *exactly* the spec formula? | direct `apply(b,p,env)`, hand-built env, assert Δv |
| **Integrator tests** | `core/integrator.test.ts` | Does the loop *around* forces hold (friction, heat decay, edge wrap, the velocity cap, the modifier pass, first-class mass, conserved-attention/causality)? | `step()` over a `FieldStore` |
| **Conformance suite** | `conformance/` | Fire a particle into a force — *did the expected behavior occur*? | `runScenario()` + declarative expectations |
| **Safety sweep** | `conformance/safety.test.ts` | Does *every* experiment stay finite, bounded, and conserved across its whole trajectory? | global invariants over the `EXPERIMENTS` catalog |
| **Benchmark** | `bench/integrator.bench.ts` | How fast is the hot loop? (perf, not correctness) | timed `step()` at several scales |

How they relate:

- **Golden tests pin the coefficients.** They call a force's `apply()` directly with a
  hand-set `env` (`dx`, `dy`, `dist` precomputed) and assert the precise Δv. They catch a
  wrong constant even when the direction is right. Helpers `body()` / `part()` / `env()` /
  `near()` are shared across the three files.
- **The conformance suite pins the behavior.** It runs the *real* engine on a controlled
  scenario and checks named invariants (direction, speed change, conservation, …) plus an
  exact Δv where the formula is clean. It is the systematic, completeness-guarded layer,
  and it is the same catalog the Lab renders.
- **Integrator tests pin the surroundings** — the per-frame friction (`×0.95`), heat decay
  (`×0.972`), toroidal wrap, the `|v| ≤ c` velocity cap, the `modify()` pass, and the opt-in
  systems.
- **The safety sweep pins the floor.** Beyond each force's own expectations, it runs every
  experiment and asserts the whole trajectory stays finite (no NaN/Infinity), positions
  finite, speed ≤ `c`, heat bounded, and the particle count stable unless a budgeted [S]
  source is active — the net that catches a runaway a bespoke check would miss.
- **The benchmark is not a correctness gate** — it tracks throughput so a regression is
  visible (`pnpm --filter field-ui bench`).

Run everything with `pnpm --filter field-ui test` (Node's built-in `node:test`, zero
test framework). RNG forces are seeded, so the suite is deterministic across runs.

---

## The conformance system

Lives in `packages/core/src/conformance/`, exported from the package so the Lab imports
the exact same code the tests run.

```
Scenario     a known particle (or particles) fired into a force with known attributes
runScenario  builds its own FieldStore + Body + Env, runs the real step() N frames,
             returns the trajectory + each particle's frame-0 force delta
Expectation  { label, kind: 'invariant'|'exact', check(result) → {pass, measured, expected} }
EXPERIMENTS  one ForceConformance { scenario, expectations[] } per registered force
```

### Scenario

```ts
interface Scenario {
  force: string;                 // the force under test
  tokens?: string[];             // body tokens (default [force]); modifiers pair, e.g. ['resonate','attract']
  family: 'canonical' | 'natural' | 'extended';
  klass: 'A' | 'B' | 'C' | 'D' | 'S' | 'modifier';
  body: Partial<Body>;           // strength, range, spin, angle, M, cx, cy, hw, hh, …
  particles: ScenarioParticle[]; // initial state(s); particles[0] is the tracked test particle
  frames: number;                // how long to simulate
  seed?: number;                 // for RNG forces (thermal, jet) → reproducible
}
```

### The classes

The class decides how `runScenario` wires the environment (§20.1):

- **`A` — body → particle.** Single particle, no services. 20 forces.
- **`B` — particle ↔ particle.** Needs `env.neighbors` (a real spatial hash). `collide`,
  `cohesion`, `pressure`, `link`, `hunt`, `align`.
- **`C` — field-buffer.** Needs `env.grid` (a real `ScalarGrid` advanced each frame).
  `diffuse`, `propagate`, `memory`.
- **`D` — shape-assignment.** Springs each particle to a point in the body's `targets`
  set (a sampled mark / chart / logo — never words, §11), assigned by a stable hash of
  the particle's scatter fraction. `morph`.
- **`S` — source / sink.** `apply()` is a no-op; the work is in `source()`, run once per
  body per frame to *create* matter via `env.spawn`. Breaks conservation by design, so it
  self-budgets (a per-particle lifespan `age` + a hard pool ceiling). `spawn`.
- **`modifier`.** `apply()` is a no-op; the work is in `modify()`, which scales or gates
  sibling forces. `resonate`, `spotlight`.

### runScenario

Mirrors `integrator.bench.ts`: a `FieldStore` seeded with the scenario particle(s), a
full `Body` from `scenario.body`, an `Env` with **real** `store.neighbors` (class B) and a
**real** `ScalarGridImpl` stepped each frame (class C). It runs the real `step()` for
`frames`, capturing `{x, y, vx, vy, heat, speed}` per particle per frame. For RNG forces
it temporarily swaps `Math.random` for a seeded `mulberry(seed)` and restores it. It also
computes `applyDelta` — one direct `apply()` with hand-set `dx/dy/dist`, the pure
frame-0 force effect *before* friction — which the exact and direction/speed checks use
(the trajectory itself is friction-damped, so those checks read `applyDelta`, while
position checks read the trajectory).

### Expectation vocabulary

Reusable builders in `conformance/expectations.ts`. Each returns `{pass, measured,
expected}` so the Lab can show the numbers.

| Builder | Asserts |
|---|---|
| `movesToward()` / `movesAway()` | the frame-0 Δv points in / out along the body axis |
| `exactDelta(dvx, dvy, tol)` | the precise frame-0 Δv (the spec formula) |
| `speedPreserved(tol)` | `|v + Δv| ≈ |v|` — a rotation, no work |
| `speedReduced()` | speed bled off (viscosity) |
| `perpendicularToVelocity(tol)` | `Δv · v ≈ 0`, `Δv ≠ 0` (Lorentz, no work) |
| `momentumConserved(tol)` | `Σ Δv ≈ 0` across the particle set (elastic collision) |
| `separates()` | two particles end farther apart than they began |
| `approachesBody()` / `recedesFromBody()` | the track ends closer / farther over time |
| `noEffectBeyondRange()` | a probe past `~1.6× range` gets no Δv |
| `followsGradient(gx, gy)` | a `[C]` force deposits a mark and steers up the grid gradient |
| `gatesOutsideCone(in, out)` | a modifier gates siblings outside a heading cone, acts inside |
| `modulatesStrength()` | a modifier scales sibling strength `1 + sin(ωt)` |
| `unaffectedWhenNeutral()` | the force ignores charge-free matter (`charge`) |
| `adoptsTint()` | the particle takes on and carries the body tint (`pigment`) |

### Verdict

A force passes its experiment iff **every** expectation passes. `conformance.test.ts`
enforces two things: completeness (every registered force token has an experiment — the
same guard as `manual.test.ts`) and correctness (every expectation of every experiment
passes). In the Lab, the same per-expectation results render as a **MATCH / NO-MATCH**
verdict; tuning a parameter re-runs `runScenario` live. (Exact checks are pinned to each
experiment's default attributes, so once you tune they go *default-only* and drop out of
the verdict while the tuning-robust invariants keep proving the physics.)

---

## The catalog

Every registered force, with the experiment that verifies it. `d` is the
particle→body distance, `r` the range, `S` the strength, `û` the unit vector toward the
body. "Δv" is the frame-0 effect on a still particle unless a velocity is given.

### Canonical nine (§6)

| Force | Fired in | Expected behavior | Exact Δv | Law |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `attract` | still p, 150px out, S 1, r 300 | pulled toward the body; falls with distance; nothing past range | `(0.125, 0)` | `f=(1−d/r)²·S·0.5` inward (§6.1) |
| `repel` | still p, 150px out, S 1, r 300 | pushed away; mirror of attract | `(−0.125, 0)` | same `f`, outward (§6.6) |
| `swirl` | still p, 150px out, spin +1 | mostly tangential swirl + a small inward retention | `(0.020, −0.171)` | `f=(1−d/r)^1.4·S·0.45`; tangential ±`spin`, +0.12 inward (§6.8) |
| `stream` | still p, heading +x | a steady current along the heading | `(0.233, 0)` | `f=(1−d/r)^1.1·S·0.5` along `(ux,uy)` (§6.5) |
| `viscosity` | p moving `vx=5` | speed bled off, no redirection (Δv ⟂-free at any velocity) | `(−0.3, 0)` | `v −= v·k`, `k=(1−d/r)(0.05+S·0.07)` (§6.7) |
| `jet` | p inside the nozzle (d<24) | relaunched as a fast jet along the heading, recedes from the body | — | feed `f=(1−d/r)²(0.25+S·0.15)`; nozzle jet `spd=2.4+S·2.6` (§6.2) |
| `tether` | still p inside the rest shell (d 150 < rest 180) | pushed back out toward the rest radius, lightly damped | `(−0.532, 0)` | `v += û(d−rest)k`, `rest=r·0.6`, damp `×0.985` (§6.3) |
| `wall` | p moving into the wall box | elastic bounce — velocity reverses, damped (`e≈0.85`) | reverses sign | axis-aligned wall on the element box (§6.4) |
| `sink` | still p inside `absorbR` | captured (`accreted++`), then drifts to the core; releases at capacity | — | capture → supernova at `capacity` (§6.9) |

### Natural primitives (§20.10)

| Force | Fired in | Expected behavior | Class | Law |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `gravity` | still p near `M=2000` | pulled inward; ends closer; nothing past range | A | softened `F=GM·û/(d²+ε²)`, `ε=2GM/c²` |
| `charge` | like-signed p (`q=+1`) by `spin +1` | like repels (opposite would attract); neutral matter unaffected | A | `s=−σ·q·GM`; same kernel as gravity |
| `magnetism` | moving charged p (`vx=5`, S 0.05) | curves ⟂ to velocity, doing no work — speed preserved | A | Lorentz `F=qB·(−v_y, v_x)` |
| `thermal` | p in a bath, seeded | agitated into motion; kicks isotropic (comparable spread on both axes) | A | Langevin `σ=√(2·S·(1−d/r))`, Box–Muller |
| `collide` | two approaching discs | momentum conserved across the pair; they separate after | B | elastic half-impulse along the contact normal, `e=S` |
| `diffuse` | p over a pheromone grid | deposits a mark and steers up the diffused gradient | C | `∂φ/∂t=D∇²φ`; follow `∇φ` |
| `propagate` | p near an engaged jet | injects a shock (when engaged) and rides the wavefront | C | wave `∂²φ/∂t²=c²∇²φ` |
| `memory` | still p, 120px out | an attractive pull amplified by how worn the spot is | C | pull `×(1 + 0.5·M(x))`, slow-decay occupancy |

### Designed-extended (§20.3)

| Force | Fired in | Expected behavior | Class | Law |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `lens` | moving p (`vx=5`), θmax 0.3 | path bent without adding energy — speed preserved, rotated by θ | A | `θ=θmax(1−d/r)·spin`, `v ← rotate(v,θ)` |
| `gate` | p crossing against the heading | the wrong-way crosser is reflected back along `n` | A | if `v·n<0`: `v −= 2(v·n)n` |
| `buoyancy` | hot, large p (light) | light matter rises (`−y`); dense settles | A | `v_y −= (ρ_med − ρ_p)g`, `ρ_p=base/(size(1+heat))` |
| `shear` | p offset ⟂ to the flow axis | dragged along the axis in proportion to its ⟂ offset | A | `v_∥ += S·(offset_⊥/r)(1−d/r)` |
| `crystallize` | cool p off a lattice node | snaps toward the nearest node and settles; melts when hot | A | `v += (node−p)·k`, damp `×0.9`, while `heat<0.5` |
| `align` | p among neighbours moving +y | steers toward the neighbour-mean heading, preserving speed | B | `v += (ĥ·|v| − v)·k`, `ĥ`=mean neighbour dir |
| `wind` | p in a global gust | a non-zero, divergence-free curl-noise push | A | `v += curl(ψ)·S`, `∇·curl ≡ 0` |
| `cohesion` | two particles at mid-range | mid-range neighbours draw together (surface tension); push when too close | B | push `d<r₀`, pull `r₀<d<r₁`, `r₀=r₁·0.5` |
| `pressure` | two overlapping particles | over-dense matter spreads apart to an even fill; momentum conserved | B | `ρ=Σ W(d,h)`, `v += −k·(ρ−ρ₀)·∇W`, `ρ₀=0.5` |
| `link` | two particles past the rest length | a stretched bond pulls back toward `L`; momentum conserved | B | `e=d−L`, `v += ½k·(e/L)·û`, `L=range·0.35` |
| `morph` | three particles, a three-point mark | each particle settles on its assigned target; the mark assembles | D | `v += (t−p)·k + jitter·(1−arrived)`, target by `hash(gx)` |
| `hunt` | a predator and a prey particle | the predator accelerates toward the prey; the prey flees; the pair migrates | B | predator `v += seek·S`, prey `v += flee·S`, by `species` |
| `spawn` | an engaged source, empty field | the pool grows as matter is emitted along the heading; mortal matter despawns | S | `source()` emits `round(S·2)`/frame, `age`-budgeted |
| `resonate` | modifier on `attract` | scales the sibling's strength as `1 + sin(ωt)` (ω=3) | modifier | `modify → {strength}` |
| `spotlight` | modifier on `stream` | gates the sibling outside a ~60° heading cone, lets it act inside | modifier | `modify → {gate}` when `û·heading < 0.5` |
| `pigment` | p overlapping a tinted body | adopts the body's tint and carries it away (conserved colour) | A | `c_p ← mix(c_p, tint)` on overlap (`d<0.6r`) |
| `fieldflow` | neutral p in a charge's field | streams OUT along the field line; ends farther from the body; inert past range | A | steer `v += (n̂·\|v\| − v)·k` + stream `v += n̂·gain·a`, `n̂ = net field()/\|field\|` |

### Composition & conditions

Forces aren't only verified one at a time — a body can carry several tokens (they
**compose**) and gate on a condition (`data-when`). A second catalog,
`COMPOSITE_EXPERIMENTS`, verifies those two mechanisms (run alongside the per-force
catalog by `conformance.test.ts`):

| Experiment | Fired in | Expected behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `attract repel` | equal attractor + repeller on one body | the two cancel — net Δv ≈ 0 |
| `attract swirl` | one body, both forces | composes to the **sum** of the parts — an inward pull *and* a tangential swirl (Δv ≈ (0.146, −0.171)) |
| `attract` + `data-when="fast"` | a fast and a slow particle | the gate lets the **fast** particle through (pulled toward the body) and **blocks** the slow one (left alone) |

Condition gating runs through the real condition registry (`active`, `fast`, `slow`,
`hot`, `cool`), so the trajectory reflects the gate frame by frame.

## Adding a force

1. Implement and register it (`forces/*.ts`), with a **golden test** pinning its exact
   per-frame math.
2. Add a **`ForceConformance`** entry to `conformance/experiments.ts`: a scenario that
   fires a representative particle into it, plus the invariants (and an `exactDelta` where
   the formula is clean) that define "appropriate reaction".
3. Document it in the catalog above (one row). The completeness guards fail until a force
   is covered in both the catalog of experiments **and** this document.
4. It appears in the Lab picker automatically (the picker is driven by `EXPERIMENTS`).

---

## Coverage

- **34 forces**, each with an experiment (34 `EXPERIMENTS` + 3 `COMPOSITE_EXPERIMENTS`,
  ~71 invariant/exact checks), driven through the real engine and deterministic across
  runs, on top of the golden per-force unit tests and the integrator suite. A **safety
  sweep** then runs all 37 experiments through global finite/bounded/conserved invariants
  (no NaN/Infinity, speed ≤ `c`, bounded heat, stable count). **362 core tests** in all,
  every merge green.
- **Composition + conditions** are covered, not deferred: `COMPOSITE_EXPERIMENTS` verifies
  that forces compose (`attract repel` cancel; `attract swirl` sums to a spiral) and gate
  on conditions (`data-when` runs through the real condition registry).
- The Lab adds a **parameter-sweep** view (vary one input across its range and plot the
  response curve) and a per-particle **speed waveform** on the timeline.
