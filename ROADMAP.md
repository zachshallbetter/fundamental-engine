# Roadmap — the refactor to world-class

The prototype (`docs/reference/`) is plain global-script DOM + one `rAF` loop:
brilliant, but untyped, monolithic, and bound to one page. The goal is a clean,
typed, modular, framework-agnostic engine that realizes the spec
(`docs/forces-system.md`) without losing the feel.

Guiding principles:

- **The spec is the contract.** `docs/forces-system.md` is law; code conforms to it.
- **Grow primitives rarely.** New ideas are composites or emergent behavior (§20.0).
- **One source of truth.** `src/config/forces.config.ts` — never re-declare catalog data.
- **Framework-agnostic core.** Zero UI-framework deps in the engine; adapters are separate.
- **Make the transfer legible.** Micro-reactions (§23) are first-class, not polish.

## Phase 0 — Foundation ✅ (in progress)

- [x] Project scaffold (TS, tsup, vitest, strict).
- [x] Canonical catalog typed from `ds-data.js` → `config/forces.config.ts`.
- [x] Core contracts → `core/types.ts` (Particle · Body · Env · Force · Agent).
- [x] `pnpm install` + green `typecheck` / `test`.

## Phase 1 — The core engine ✅

- [x] `FieldStore`: particle pool + uniform-grid spatial index + `Env` services
      (`grid`/`spark`/`supernova` stubbed for later phases).
- [x] The loop + integrator + the reduced-motion `dt=0` path (§18). Unit-mass path
      for now; first-class `a = F/m` is Phase 6 (§21.4).
- [x] Body scanner: `[data-body]` → bodies, re-measured per frame (§2.1).
      `[data-preset]` lands with the preset layer (§20.9).
- [x] `node:test` coverage — integrator, store, spatial hash, scanner, conditions,
      math (25 tests), incl. the reduced-motion and edge-wrap (conservation) cases.
- [x] `createField` browser entry + a minimal particle renderer; `<forces-field>`
      mounts it. (Forces themselves are Phase 2; Currents + full render are Phase 3.)

> Toolchain note: source uses `.ts` import extensions + `rewriteRelativeImportExtensions`
> so `node:test` runs the source directly and `tsc` emits Node-valid `.js`. Zero test/build
> framework — just TypeScript.

## Phase 2 — Forces, conditions, formations ✅

- [x] The canonical nine as modules in `forces/` (§6), registered into `createField`;
      absorb capture → supernova release (§6.9) + captured-particle drift.
- [x] Condition predicates (`data-when`: active/fast/slow/hot/cool) — built in Phase 1.
      Remaining: the selective-gate-on-bound-particles rule (with Currents, Phase 3).
- [x] Formations: eased global bias (`easeFormation`, lerp 0.03/frame), the
      `spread`/`conv`/brownian terms, and the scroll-journey conductor
      (`[data-formation]` sections in view → ease; idle → `ambient`) (§7).
- [x] Golden tests: each force's per-frame math matches the spec formulas (13 tests).

Carried over from the Phase 1 conformance audit:

- [x] **Formation easing** — `easeFormation` lerps the active preset toward target
      at 0.03/frame; `setFormation` sets the target (§7).
- [x] **Formation terms** — integrator now applies `driftX`, curl-noise, periodic
      **brownian** (every 40 frames), **`spread`** (`Particle.gx/gy`), and **`conv`**
      (accretion target via `accretionTarget`) (§7).
- [ ] **`FieldHandle` surface** — add `threads()` (§10, Phase 4) and `burst()`
      (§11, interaction) to match the §13 API. Deferred to their phases.
- Phase 3 will also bring: the cool→warm distance render ramp + accent blend
  (§20.8 — Phase 1 ships a minimal heat-only tint), and `alpha:false` vs the
  current transparent-overlay canvas (deliberate, revisit with Currents).

## Phase 3 — Substrate & Currents ✅

- [x] Currents (`currents.ts`): 5 wave layers + bound shimmer riding them + the
      wave-current flow that drifts free particles along the slope (§24, §2.3).
- [x] Wave rendering (gradient fills + glowing strokes) over an opaque dark
      substrate; the cool-baseline wave palette (§24.4); upgraded free-particle
      render — cool centre → warm edge → accent (`particleRGB`, §20.8).
- [x] The conservation **reservoir** (`reservoir.ts`, §2.4): wave-healing reclaims
      calm free matter onto the lines (capped at `boundTarget`); a supernova tears
      nearby bound matter loose. Count conserved throughout.
- [x] **Force-tearing** (`tearBoundByForces`): any force reaching a bound particle
      tears it loose so it feels the force (selective gates skip bound).
- [x] **The "spine"** — waves bend toward the engaged element (`waveYat` pull);
      hover/focus a `[data-hot]` element to engage it (`b.on` → on-state forces).
- [x] **Accent journey** (§9): scroll travels the palette (`sampleStops`), a
      hovered `[data-color]` element overrides; the field recolours with it.

## Phase 4 — Agents & reciprocity (§22) + word effects ✅

Ordered for overnight (highest visible value first):

- [x] **4a — Two-way density feedback (§8).** Per `data-feedback` body, sample local
      density (`count` within `range·0.5`), ease into `--d`; expose `--mass`/`--load`
      for absorbers; optionally drive variable-font weight via `data-fmin/fmax/opsz`.
- [x] **4w — Word effects (the punctuation rule, §11 note).** Wire the site hero
      word(s) with `data-feedback` + CSS so `--d` drives weight + `text-shadow` glow
      + colour (glow/grow). **No particle-into-letterform assembly.** Optional one-shot
      ripple/spark on engage.
- [x] **4b — Threads (§10).** `__field.threads(list)` — glowing connector lines with
      travelling pulses between an engaged `[data-index][data-threads]` set.
- [x] **4c — Element agent (§22.4).** `[data-target]` elements moved by forces via a
      transform offset (element mass `m_el`); anchor spring + field pressure.
- [x] **4d — Event agent (§22.5).** `data-on="dense:field:lit, captured:field:dock"`
      → debounced `CustomEvent`s carrying `{ body, influence, value }`.

## Phase 5 — Micro-reactions (§23) ✅

- [x] **5a — Reaction kit + budget.** `ΔE → I`; spark/flash/pulse primitives; wire
      `env.spark` to a real spark draw pass (reflect already calls it).
- [x] **5b — Recoil (the missing side, §23.5).** reflect/collide push back on the
      body/agent split by mass; **chromatic shed** (tint by the acting force, §20.8).
- [x] **5c — Render modes (§20.6).** trails, links, knockout — the easy high-impact ones.

## Phase 6 — Depth: physical primitives, presets, mass

- [x] **`gravity` + `charge`** — the shared softened inverse-square kernel
      (`s/(d²+ε²)`, Plummer ε=r_s, |v|≤c), in `forces/natural.ts`; opt-in, registered
      alongside the nine. Golden-tested (§20.10).
- [x] **`magnetism`** — the Lorentz force (`F = qB·(−v_y, v_x)`), perpendicular to
      velocity so it curls a moving charge without doing work; `spin` sets the
      out-of-plane sense. In `forces/natural.ts`, golden-tested (§20.10). Completes
      the EM pair with `charge`.
- [x] **`thermal`** — Langevin/Brownian agitation (`v += √(2T)·ξ`), the honest
      `wander`; paired with `drag` it's a fluctuation–dissipation thermostat. Pure
      `thermalSigma` + isotropic Box–Muller kick, in `forces/natural.ts` (§20.10).
- [ ] Remaining natural primitives: `propagate`, `collide`, `diffuse` (§20.10) — each
      needs Env services (scalar `grid` for propagate/diffuse, `neighbors` for collide),
      i.e. engine plumbing beyond a single small force; do them when that lands.
- [x] **The preset layer** (§20.9) — `data-preset="blackhole"` expands to several
      co-located virtual bodies (one primitive each, own attrs, shared rect) via
      `expandPreset`; `config/presets.ts` holds the table (blackhole/whitehole/star).
      Opt-in, additive to the scanner; `data-body` path untouched. The cosmology family
      as composition, no engine growth. (`lens`/`warp`/`spawn` composites await those atoms.)
- [ ] First-class mass (Option B) on Lab/cosmology surfaces (§21.3).

## Designed extended forces (§20.3, class [A] — opt-in, pure per-particle)

- [x] **`lens`** — rotates velocity preserving speed (`θ = θ_max·(1−d/d_max)·sign`);
      a path bend with no energy. In `forces/extended.ts`; also restored to the
      `blackhole` preset. Golden-tested (§20.3).
- [x] **`gate`** — a one-way membrane: passes matter along its heading `n`, reflects
      wrong-way crossers (`v −= 2(v·n)·n`); box-sized like `reflect`. `forces/extended.ts` (§20.3).
- [x] **`buoyancy`** — constant lift/sink by density difference (`ρ_p = base/(size·(1+heat))`);
      hot/large matter rises, dense settles; `range 0` = global. `forces/extended.ts` (§20.3).
- [x] **`shear`** — a laminar velocity gradient (Couette): flow speed along the axis
      grows with perpendicular offset (`v_∥ += S·(offset_⊥/d_max)·(1−d/d_max)`). `forces/extended.ts` (§20.3).
- [x] **`crystallize`** — a phase change: cool matter snaps onto a lattice (`v += (node−p)·k_snap`,
      then damps) and settles solid; hot matter melts and moves free. `forces/extended.ts` (§20.3).
- [x] **`align`** (heading variant) — steers velocity toward a heading preserving speed
      (`v += (ĥ·|v| − v)·k_align`). `forces/extended.ts` (§20.3). The `[B]` neighbour-mean
      variant awaits the `neighbors` service.
- [x] **`wind`** — divergence-free turbulence: the curl of a sinusoidal streamfunction
      (`v += curl(ψ)·S`, `∇·curl ≡ 0`), closed-form so deterministic. `forces/extended.ts` (§20.3).
- [ ] **DEFERRED** — `resonate` / `spotlight` are *modifier* forces that wrap a sibling
      core force (time-vary or cone-gate it); they need an integrator modifier pass
      (engine plumbing), so they wait for that. `align`'s `[B]` neighbour-mean variant
      and `wind`'s `data-scale` wiring likewise wait on their plumbing.

## Phase 7 — Adapters, the landing page, Lab, docs site

- [ ] Vanilla adapter (mount once, scan the DOM) + a React adapter.
- [ ] **forces-ui.com landing page = the Field Manual, rebuilt on the engine.**
      The current `public/index.html` is a placeholder; the real home is the
      Manual (`docs/reference/manual.html`) — it explains the system *by being it*
      (live demos behind every concept). Keep the bones & style (4-chapter arc:
      Substrate → Forces → Conditions → System; dark aesthetic, Bricolage + Martian
      Mono, Currents, force palette; demo-per-concept; chapter rail; the "every
      element has mass" thesis). Rebuild on the typed engine (it becomes forces-ui's
      first real consumer / the whole-engine integration test), reframe from
      site-specific → the forces-ui manual, fix the "eight"→nine copy, and do a
      responsive / a11y / perf pass. **Gated on Phases 1–5** (the demos must run).
- [x] **Field Cell** (`<forces-cell force="vortex">`) — an in-frame, container-sized
      single-force/formation demo surface (§25.1); the embeddable unit for the
      manual's per-concept demos and the poster/render-mode variant.
- [ ] The Lab (paint forces; shareable fields) (§14).
- [ ] A published docs site (the executable design system).

## Cross-cutting

- [ ] Performance: `ResizeObserver`/`IntersectionObserver` sync; `OffscreenCanvas` + worker.
- [ ] Accessibility: reduced motion, focus engagement, `z-index` background layer (§18).
- [ ] Naming/color reconciliation pass against the canonical palette (§20.2).
- [x] Emit the design tokens (`--f-*`, `--coherence`, `--ease`) from `forces.config.ts` (§25.2).
- [x] Public-facing explainer: Element→Field / Field→Element, anatomy of a body,
      "captured = released" (§25 + possibilities); the plain-language on-ramp.

## Stack (decided)

A pnpm monorepo. The **core engine is framework-agnostic**; consumers reach it
through a **web-component** keystone so it drops into anything.

| Package | What | Tech |
|---|---|---|
| `packages/core` (`forces-ui`) | the engine — catalog, contracts, FieldStore, forces | vanilla TS |
| `packages/elements` (`@forces-ui/elements`) | `<forces-field>` + declarative `data-body` | web components (plain now; Lit when there's UI to template, e.g. the Lab) |
| `apps/site` (`@forces-ui/site`) | forces-ui.com — the manual / landing | Astro (static; Lit islands later) |
| `packages/react` (later) | thin React adapter | React |

Why web components as the keystone: "every element is a body" is a web-components-
shaped idea; a custom element works in React/Svelte/Astro/plain HTML unchanged →
forces-ui is a *platform*, not a framework library. The site shell (Astro) is a
separate, swappable choice and shares no code with the engine.

## Open decisions

- First-class mass everywhere vs. unit-mass UI + first-class Lab (§21.4) — leaning split.
- Final package name & the 24-force palette reconciliation (§20.2).
- Site shell stays Astro vs. SvelteKit/Next (Astro chosen; cheap to revisit — it
  shares no engine code).
